# JPAR

This is a JSON parser to check valid and invalid json output and input in the command line. The executable is dynamically linked but all you really need to build this project is base-devel and the most latest gcc or clang available in your repos.

### Usage: 
```
chmod +x setup.sh
./setup.sh
```
